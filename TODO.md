To-Do List
==========

Big steps
---------
* Implement decision tree growing in single-threading
	* Write tests
* Implement decision tree prediction in single-threading
	* write tests
* Implement R interface and connect with FORTRAN 90 code
* Implement decision tree fitting in multi-threading
* Implement decision tree estimation in multi-threading

Loose ends
----------
* have comment to indicate when a test is on sorted data only
* review and fix any bad pointer practices
* explicitly indicate public/private access in classification module
